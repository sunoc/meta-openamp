meta-openamp
===================

This layer provides support for building libmetal and OpenAMP libraries.

[FORK] GPIO
------------

The purpose of this fork is to toggle some GPIO pins of the KR260 board while
trying to send the "echo" messages as fast as possible.

I try to measure the best case scenario for RPMsg replies.
